# Credits
Due to personal difficulties with finding documentation on beatoraja lua skins, LITONE was heavily referenced to help with understanding the structure of lua skins. While as much of the skin was created from scratch as possible, it's inevitable some code and asset similarities will be noticed, so I feel it's important to credit the skin I've referenced during development. Be sure to support LITONE and DESOUT 2 here! https://desout2.tk/
